# dbt_pinterest_source v0.6.0

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- The `pin_promotion_report_pass_through_metric` variable has been renamed to `pinterest__pin_promotion_report_passthrough_metrics`. ([#18](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest_source/pull/18))
- The declaration of passthrough variables within your root `dbt_project.yml` has changed. To allow for more flexibility and better tracking of passthrough columns, you will now want to define passthrough metrics in the following format: ([#18](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest_source/pull/18))
> This applies to all passthrough metrics within the `dbt_pinterest_source` package and not just the `pinterest__pin_promotion_report_passthrough_metrics` example.
```yml
vars:
  pinterest__pin_promotion_report_passthrough_metrics:
    - name: "my_field_to_include" # Required: Name of the field within the source.
      alias: "field_alias" # Optional: If you wish to alias the field within the staging model.
```
## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Enhancements ðŸŽ‰
PR [#18](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest_source/pull/18) includes the following changes:
- Addition of the following staging models which pull from the source counterparts. The inclusion of the additional `_report` source tables is to generate a more accurate representation of the Pinterest Ads data. For example, not all Ad types are included within the `pin_promotion_report` table. Therefore, the addition of the further grain reports will allow for more flexibility and accurate Pinterest Ad reporting. 
  - `stg_pinterest_ads__ad_group_report`
  - `stg_pinterest_ads__advertiser_report`
  - `stg_pinterest_ads__campaign_report`
  - `stg_pinterest_ads__keyword_report`
  - `stg_pinterest_ads__advertiser_history`
  - `stg_pinterest_ads__keyword_history`

- Inclusion of additional passthrough metrics: 
  - `pinterest__ad_group_report_passthrough_metrics`
  - `pinterest__campaign_report_passthrough_metrics`
  - `pinterest__advertiser_report_passthrough_metrics`
  - `pinterest__keyword_report_passthrough_metrics`

- README updates for easier navigation and use of the package. 
- Addition of identifier variables for each of the source tables to allow for further flexibility in source table direction within the dbt project.
- Included grain uniqueness tests for each staging table.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. The latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.
