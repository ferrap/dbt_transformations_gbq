# Ad Reporting dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_ad_reporting/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Standardizes schemas from various ad platform connectors and creates reporting models for clicks, spend and impressions aggregated to the account, campaign, ad group, ad, keyword and search levels. 
- Currently supports the following Fivetran ad platform connectors:
    - [Apple Search Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads)
    - [Facebook Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_facebook_ads)
    - [Google Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads)
    - [LinkedIn Ad Analytics](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin)
    - [Microsoft Advertising](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads)
    - [Pinterest Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest)
    - [Snapchat Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads)
    - [TikTok Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_tiktok_ads)
    - [Twitter Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter)
> NOTE: You do _not_ need to have all of these connector types to use this package, though you should have at least two.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled App Reporting data via the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_ad_reporting/)

Refer to the table below for a detailed view of final models materialized by default within this package. Additionally, check out our [Docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_ad_reporting/#!/overview) for more details about these models.

> The individual platform models may have additional platform-specific metrics and fields better suited for deep-dive analyses at the platform level.

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Pre-Requisites
- **Connector**: Have all relevant Fivetran app platform connectors syncing data into your warehouse. This package currently supports:
    - [Apple Search Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/apple-search-ads)
    - [Facebook Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/facebook-ads)
    - [Google Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/google-ads)
    - [LinkedIn Ad Analytics](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/linkedin-ads)
    - [Microsoft Advertising](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/microsoft-advertising)
    - [Pinterest Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/pinterest-ads)
    - [Snapchat Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/snapchat-ads)
    - [TikTok Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/tiktok-ads)
    - [Twitter Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/twitter-ads)
- **Database support**: This package has been tested on **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **Postgres** and **Databricks**. Ensure you are using one of these supported databases.
- **dbt Version**: This dbt package requires you have a functional dbt project that utilizes a dbt version within the respective range `>=1.0.0, <2.0.0`.
- For Facebook Ads compatibility, please ensure that you have configured the necessary pre-built reports. Please refer to the [Facebook Ads package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_facebook_ads/tree/main#step-1-prerequisites) for more information.

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Include the following github package version in your `packages.yml`
> Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/ad_reporting
    version: [">=1.0.0", "<1.1.0"]
```
## Step 3: Configure Database and Schema Variables
By default, this package looks for your ad platform data in your target database. If this is not where your app platform data is stored, add the relevant `<connector>_database` variables to your `dbt_project.yml` file (see below).

```yml
vars:
    apple_search_ads_schema: apple_search_ads
    apple_search_ads_database: your_database_name

    facebook_ads_schema: facebook_ads
    facebook_ads_database: your_database_name 

    google_ads_schema: google_ads
    google_ads_database: your_database_name 

    microsoft_ads_schema: bingads
    microsoft_ads_database: your_database_name

    linkedin_ads_schema: linkedin_ads 
    linkedin_ads_database: your_database_name  

    pinterest_schema: pinterest
    pinterest_database: your_database_name 

    twitter_ads_schema: twitter_ads
    twitter_ads_database: your_database_name  

    snapchat_schema: snapchat_ads
    snapchat_database: your_database_name 
    
    tiktok_ads_schema: tiktok_ads
    tiktok_ads_database: your_database_name 
```

## Step 4: Enabling/Disabling Models
This package takes into consideration that not every account will have every feature enabled per platform. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in your respective ad platforms or have actively excluded some tables from your syncs. 

### Disable Platform Specific Reporting
If you would like to disable all reporting for any specific platform, please include the respective variable(s) in your `dbt_project.yml`. 

```yml
vars:
  ad_reporting__apple_search_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__pinterest_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__microsoft_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__linkedin_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__google_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__twitter_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__facebook_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__snapchat_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__tiktok_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
```
### Enable/Disable Specific Reports within Platforms
For **Apple Search Ads**, if you are not utilizing the search functionality, you may choose to update the respective variable below.

For **Twitter Ads**, if you are tracking keyword performance, you may choose to update the corresponding variable below.

Add the following variables to your dbt_project.yml file

```yml
vars:
  apple_search_ads__using_search_terms: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  twitter_ads__using_keywords: False # by default this is assumed to be True
```

## (Recommended) Step 5: Change the Build Schema
By default this package will build all models in your `<target_schema>` with the respective package suffixes (see below). This behavior can be tailored to your preference by making use of custom schemas. If you would like to override the current naming conventions, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file and rename `+schema` configs:

```yml
models:  
  ad_reporting:
    +schema: ad_reporting

  apple_search_ads:
    +schema: apple_search_ads
  apple_search_ads_source:
    +schema: apple_search_ads_source
  
  facebook_ads:
    +schema: facebook_ads
  facebook_ads_source:
    +schema: facebook_ads_source
  
  google_ads:
    +schema: google_ads
  google_ads_source:
    +schema: google_ads_source

  linkedin:
    +schema: linkedin
  linkedin_source:
    +schema: linkedin_source

  microsoft_ads:
    +schema: microsoft_ads
  microsoft_ads_source:
    +schema: microsoft_ads_source

  pinterest:
    +schema: pinterest
  pinterest_source:
    +schema: pinterest_source
  
  twitter_ads:
    +schema: twitter_ads
  twitter_ads_source:
    +schema: twitter_ads_source
  
  snapchat_ads:
    +schema: snapchat_ads
  snapchat_ads_source:
    +schema: snapchat_ads_source
  
  tiktok_ads:
    +schema: tiktok_ads
  tiktok_ads_source:
    +schema: tiktok_ads_source
```

> Provide a blank `+schema: ` to write to the `target_schema` without any suffix.

## (Optional) Step 6: Additional configurations
<details><summary>Expand for details</summary>
<br>

### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:
> IMPORTANT: See the Apple Store [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml)  and Google Play [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_play_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.
    
```yml
vars:
    <default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
    
</details>
<br>

## (Optional) Step 7: Orchestrate your models with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™

Fivetran offers the ability for you to orchestrate your dbt project through [Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt). Learn how to set up your project for orchestration through Fivetran in our [Transformations for dbt Core™ setup guides](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt#setupguide).

</details>
<br>

## (Optional) Step 8: Use predefined Metrics
<details><summary>Expand for details</summary>

On top of the `ad_reporting__ad_report` final model, the Ad Reporting dbt package defines common [Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics), including:
- Spend
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Cost per click
- Clickthrough rate
- Bounce rate
- Count of active ads
- Average spend
- Average non-zero spend

You can find the supported dimensions and full definitions of these metrics [here](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/blob/main/models/ad_reporting_metrics.yml).

To use dbt Metrics, add the [dbt metrics package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt_metrics) to your project's `packages.yml` file:
```yml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/metrics
    version: [">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]
```
> **Note**: The Metrics package has stricter dbt version requirements. As of today, the latest version of Metrics (v0.3.5) requires dbt `[">=1.2.0-a1", "<2.0.0"]`.

To utilize the Ad Reporting's pre-defined metrics in your code, refer to the [dbt metrics package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt_metrics) usage instructions and the example below:
```sql
select *
from {{ metrics.calculate(
        metric('clicks'),
        grain='month',
        dimensions=['platform', 
                    'campaign_id', 
                    'campaign_name'
        ],
        secondary_calculations=[
            metrics.period_over_period(comparison_strategy='difference', interval=1, alias='diff_last_mth'),
            metrics.period_over_period(comparison_strategy='ratio', interval=1, alias='ratio_last_mth')
        ]
) }}
```
